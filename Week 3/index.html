        <h1>All About the Miniature Schnauzer</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <section>
            <blockquote>The Miniature Schnauzer, the smallest of the three Schnauzer breeds, is a generally healthy, long-lived, and low-shedding companion. Add an outgoing personality, a portable size, and sporty good looks, and you've got an ideal family dog. <cite>The American Kennel Club</cite>

            The Miniature Schnauzer is a small, German breed of dog, related to the Standard and Giant Schnauzers. They are recognized by their angular build and a characteristic large beard. In fact, their name in German is <em>Zwergschnauzer</em>, which translates to <em>"dwarf mustache"</em>. This breed of dog was developed to serve as ratters, hunting rats and other small vermin.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <section>
            According to early records, Miniature Schnauzers were developed from Standard Schauzers by breeding Standard Schnauzers with other small breeds such as the Affenpinscher, Miniature Poodle, Miniature Pinscher, or Pomeranian. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer was a black female named <em>Findel</em>, in 1888. Eventually, two years after the introduction of Miniature Schnauzers to the United States, the American Kennel Club recognized Miniature Schnauzers as a breed in 1926.

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <section>
            Miniature Schnauzers come in <strong>three</strong> AKC recognized color types: black, salt and pepper, or black and silver. White is also an offical color outside of the United States, but the AKC does not allow it for conformation showings due to uncertainty in the genetic origin of white. Miniature Schnauzers have what is considered to be a very <em>"square"</em> appearance. They range from 12-14 inches tall, and healthy dogs will weigh somewhere within 11-20 pounds. These dogs have a double coat, with a wiry topcoat and a soft undercoat. They have a bushy beard and eybrows when groomed to the standard <em>"Schnauzer cut."</em> the teeth meet in a scissor bite. The eyes are dark and oval shaped. The ears naturally have a v-shape and fold forward. The tail curls forward if left undocked. The legs are very straight and rigid, and the paws are short and round like a cat's.

        <h2>Temperament</h2>
        <section>
            Miniature Schnauzers are spunky. They are alert, spirited, and highly intelligent. This means they need the mental stimulation of work as well as a sufficient amount of exercise. They crave the ability to chase down prey, either real or simulated, and catch it. This means having access to a space where they can play fetch or other similar games, or having property that they are allowed to hunt vermin on. These dogs also make good watchdogs, but not necessarily good guard dogs. They are always alert and ready to bark at intruders, whether it's a person, an animal, or a leaf. Despite this alertness, their small size and generally friendly personality makes them less willing to bite intruders.

        <h2>Health</h2>
        <section>
            Overall, Miniature Schnauzers are a generally healthy breed. Still, the breed does have a predisposition for developing certain diseases. The common diseases that tend to affect Miniature Schnauzers are: cataracts, hyperlipidemia, pancreatitis, liver shunts, urinary stones, gallbladder mucoceles, von Willebrand disease, and Schnauzer comedo syndrome. On average, Miniature Schnauzers live around 12-15 years. This breed is robust, so fractures and other serious injuries are uncommon compared to many other small breeds.
